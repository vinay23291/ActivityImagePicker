# Icons

This component is a taddy bitty bittle bit different than others because it
depends on icomoon the way we do it now.

## How will I updation it?

If the changes you make require adjustments to the font files, you will do it
via the [Icomoon app](https://icomoon.io/app).

1. Head on over on down to icomoon.io
1. Press some button that's something about "Open App"
1. Access the hamburger menu or whatever and choose "New set from selection"
1. Provide the file, ./icomoon/selection.json
1. (You probably will need to now remove the free icon set provided by icomoon)
1. Next you can make whatever changes you feel like!
1. When you're done, press the "Generate Font" button
1. Download and extract, and move the files into the icomoon directory:
	- selection.json
	- style.css
	- fonts/*
